# Basic Aircraft Control

This plugin allows the assignment of headings, speeds, altitudes, and squawk codes to an already airborne aircraft on any frequency (make sure the aircraft is selected in Aurora!) or over PM.

Example commands:
```
DIE
FH 180
FH 180 C 050
SPD 250 D 250 FH 090
```
